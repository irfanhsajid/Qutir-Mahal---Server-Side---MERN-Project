# Qutir-Mahal the Art and Craft Shop Server-Side

Made with using `Node Js`, `MonogoDB`, `dotenv` and `Cors`. 

## What's inside?
* Firstly, I connect the node server with mongoDB and make four individual database collection to store data there. 
* To load data  and manipulate data from mongoDB I used GET, POST and DELETE method here. 
* To ensure security , I used `environment variable`
* To Run server-side globally I deploy it to `Heroku`
